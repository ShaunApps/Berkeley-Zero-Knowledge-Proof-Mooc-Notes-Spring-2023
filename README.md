# Introduction
This repository contains the notes, comments & supplementary materials made by me ([Yu Zeng](yuzeng2333.github.io/), yuzeng@princeton.edu), to record my understanding of the Mooc [Zero Knowledge Proof Course](https://zk-learning.org/). Hope it can help others too! 
Also, everyone is welcomed to help improve the notes here! Feel free to add pull request.
The notes are written with markdown. Reading it with a markdown viewer is better!
